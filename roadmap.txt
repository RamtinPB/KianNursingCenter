Our Facility Section
Content:
This section should highlight the center's infrastructure, creating a sense of trust and transparency.
Example structure:

Heading: Our Facility
Introductory Sentence:
"Designed with patient comfort and care in mind, our facility offers a safe, welcoming space for healing."
Highlight Key Features (3-5 points):
Modern Treatment Rooms: Equipped with the latest technology for effective care.
Welcoming Environment: A soothing ambiance to help patients feel at ease.
Accessible Location: Conveniently located with easy parking and wheelchair access.
Hygiene Standards: Meticulously maintained for safety and cleanliness.
Patient Lounge: Comfortable waiting areas with amenities to enhance your experience.
Design:
Create a 2-column layout:
Left Column: Use a high-quality image carousel or static image showcasing the facility (e.g., treatment room, reception, patient lounge).
Right Column: List the key features with icons or bullet points.
Add a background accent color or gradient behind this section to differentiate it visually.


so for the our facilities section i have an idea, i want to create a carousel that uses various cards to show the facilities,
the carousel will show show 3 cards at most and the 2 on the edge will be half visible and fading as they are on the sides of the carousel;
the user can then view the various cards as a normal carousel but when they hover over the particular card in the middle it will scale-105 and if the user clicks it the card will then expand to fill the entire div that the carousel used to span,
and if the user wants to go back above the new window there will be a up arrow they can click to go back to the same selection carousel window.
what do you think? pretty great right?
but i dont know how to implement it help me implement it with the tools im using (material tailwind and tailwind css)
